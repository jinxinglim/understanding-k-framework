# Understanding K Framework Exercises

## Setup

-   Install the K Framework: <https://github.com/kframework/k/releases>
-   K Framework documentation: <https://kframework.org>

## Building a Language

### Exercise 1: Calculator

Use *functional* fragment of K to correctly compute integer arithmetic expressions.
Examples in [tests/01-calc](tests/01-calc).

### Exercise 2: Calculator with Boolean Expressions

Remaining in the *functional* fragment of K, extend the calculator to deal with boolean expressions too.
Examples in [tests/02-calc-bool](tests/02-calc-bool).

### Exercise 3: Variables in Expressions, Explicit Substitution

Now we must move to the *stateful* fragment of K, which requires adding a *configuration*.
We can hardcode some variable values in the configuration for now, to allow using them in programs.
Examples in [tests/03-subst](tests/03-subst).

### Exercise 4.1: Assignment Operator

Updating the entire definition each time to change variable values is impractical.
Instead, we should provide a way for the user to update them instead.
For this, we'll add *statements*, *statement sequencing*, and an *assignment operator*.
Examples in [tests/04-assignment](tests/04-assignment).

### Exercise 4.2: Assignment Operator

Now re-do the assignment operator, but using `strict` instead of substitution for expression evaluation.

### Exercise 4.3: Assignment Operator

Now re-do the assignment operator, but using contextual functions instead of substitution for expression evaluation.

### Exercise 5: Control Flow

We want to be able to have *branches* and *loops* in our programs, to do anything interesting.
For that, we'll add an `if` statement, and a `while` loop.
Examples in [tests/05-control-flow](tests/05-control-flow).

### Exercise 6: Procedures

We can add procedures to our language to be able to bundle up chunks of code and call them in other expressions.
Examples in [tests/06-procedures](tests/06-procedures).

## Compiling the exercises and running the tests

From the root folder, you can compile a given exercise by executing:

```make [exercise-folder]/[exercise-file].kompile``` 

and then run the tests by executing:

```make tests/[exercise-folder]/[test-file].krun```.

For example, the first exercise can be compiled with 

```
make 01-calc/calc.k.kompile
```

and the first associated test can be run with 

```
make tests/01-calc/1.calc.krun
```

## Getting Started With Proofs

For the final two exercises, the example test folders ([tests/05-control-flow](tests/05-control-flow) and [tests/06-procedures](tests/06-procedures)) also include some specifications that can be proven against the final definition.
The details of how to run these proofs can be found in the corresponding exercise files ([Exercise 5](05-control-flow/README.md) and [Exercise 6](06-procedures/README.md)).
